# Triple Peaks Coffee Shop

This is the second project of the Software Engineering program at TripleTen. It was created using HTML and CSS, based on the design brief.

## Project features

- Semantic HTML5
- Flexbox
- Positioning
- Flat BEM file structure
- A custom form
- CSS animation and transform

## Plan on improving the project

What I could see as an enhancement to this project would be added functionality where the user could use a calculator to calculate an order, in the menu selection. Receive a bill and the ability to update the order.
